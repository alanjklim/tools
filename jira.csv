Hi Melissa

 

The ERWIN data model doesn’t always line up with what’s in CBS. This is because during the implementation phase there could be design flaws or that the column is logical, meaning it’s a field that may get used but isn’t.

 

For instance, when comparing ERWIN to CBS for existing Omnia tables, I found the following missing columns:

Since these are logical, they won’t be in CBS. The developer/architect for CBS should be updating ERWIN with what’s in CBS because whatever is in CBS in the final design.

Also did a check against CBS and Omnia and don’t see any new columns in CBS.

 

For CBS 16, I have added the other BM2T* tables in the subject area as filler tables ([https://confluence.rtdomau.local:8443/display/DataAnalyticsPlatform/PALM+CBS+016]){*}.{*}

 

Please let me know if there’s anything further you require.

 

Kind Regards

*Subject:* RE: CBS data - CommRem

 

Hi Vera,

 

No problem, I’m happy to explain my rationale.

 

I’ve using the interactive ERWIN data modeller to determine the most up to date table structure from CBS as my HOST access is quite limited.

 (\\cbdvdat002\Data-06\DTACBSTS\Data Model Reports\Data Model\ALL ER REPORT CURRENT)

 

I then used the Alation data dictionary to determine the table structure in the OMNIA PROD_DIL_BCB and PROD_DIL_BCB_PII schemas. ([prod_dil_bcb | Alation|https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Falation.cba%2Fschema%2F6074%2F&data=05%7C02%7CAlan.Lim1%40bankwest.com.au%7Ca59dd7193f044bad549e08dc57a23d76%7C63524e67c25c4e62af2bf1baa55676be%7C0%7C0%7C638481601532342378%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=K6Wk7mGP9292fyGoY%2Ffvo8EHzOJgwwFe9%2BQxhfbZHpU%3D&reserved=0]) . I found this by querying the Data Sources section of Alation under the “OMNIA” source .

 

Next I compared both structures of any entities that I had on my radar for Broker Commissions (from the ERWIN ER diagrams specifically in the “Account”, “Account Limit”, “Broker Commissions”, “Broker Commission Customisation” and “Broker Relationship” Subject Areas (plus a few other smaller subject areas), or that I was able to identify as being directly called in the CBS code – I used the Bit Bucket  “Proteus” repository for this as directed by Jason Soon) to get the list of discrepancies that I previously shared.

 

As an additional step I then had Jason Soon sanity-check my approach. He gave the thumbs up after ruling out a table or two that were redundant due to non existent data 😊

 

I’m happy for someone to correct me if this was not the correct approach to use; just let me know.

 

(p.s. Nicholas has just cast his eye over the 14 tables for me and we may be able to further cull this number down again to only 7 tables that require updates).

 

Thanks,

Melissa.

Hi [@Vera Pui|mailto:Vera.Pui@bankwest.com.au],

 

As of now, we are suggested to use Spark for ENR  , OAL , OBL . But for DIL all new projects are mandated to use abinitio.

 

For existing flows – Its not mandatory to change from Spark to Abinitio. But if there are new changes to existing feed in DIL , operations team might suggest to move to abinitio rather than spark .

 

Cheers,

Sathya

Hi Alan,

 

Thanks for the information. I did not know this. I'm happy to have been corrected and gladly defer to your method.

 

If you've already conducted a comparison and could not find any discrepancies between CBS and the OMNIA BCB DIL schemas then I'm happy to remove the 14 ""update"" tables from Vera's team scope and keep only the tables that do not exist at all.

 

thankyou so much.

-Melissa

*Subject:* CommRem data in Omnia

 

Hi all,

 

Do you have a contact on who’s building the CommRem report in the Omnia world once the CBS data land into Omnia DIL please?

We’d like to confirm data ingested via Spark is accepted – for those that are already in Omnia and might be needing new columns only – and there is no requirement to be ingested via Ab-inito (Palm).

 

It’d also be appreciated if you could please share ideal timeline for when the data is needed in Omnia DIL and we can work through the delivery plan to confirm whether that’s achievable or not. This would be assuming we are ready to lock scope now.

 

Happy to jump onto a call if easier.

 

Thanks,

Vera

Hi Vera

 

I’d try Sathya in the first instance [sathyamoorthy.lalbahadursastri@cba.com.au|mailto:sathyamoorthy.lalbahadursastri@cba.com.au] – Sathya is Sydney based.

 

If no joy then try Suvarna [suvarnarama.adhikarla@cba.com.au|mailto:suvarnarama.adhikarla@cba.com.au]. – Pretty sure Suvarna is India based.

Hi Vera

 

Apologies, didn’t respond to the 2{^}nd{^} part of your email.

 

Build in CommRem is to start Q1 FY25 i.e. July/August 2024. Based on this our ideal timeline to get the data into OMNIA DIL is mid July at the latest as the CBA team undertaking the enrichment process will start their work as part of the build in July/August.

 

I’ll leave it to [@Melissa|mailto:Melissa.Arnott@bankwest.com.au] re locking in scope to confirm as she is much closer but my view is that we are ready to lock in the scope now.

Hi all

 

Adding onto Vera’s email, I would to raise a delivery risk.

 

Generally it takes about 3 months for the entire ingestion process from analysis, development, testing and release. We have already crossed the expected starting point. Furthermore, there are tables not in Oracle from CBS so DBA’s have to load these in before we can even start the ingestion process.

[@Melissa Arnott|mailto:Melissa.Arnott@bankwest.com.au] has the scope been finalised because delivery before June is likely to be delayed already.

Kind Regards

Hi Alan,

 

Yes, the list I provided Vera last week is as accurate as I can get it without further delaying any delivery. It should be considered final for your increment activities.

 

James, Nick and I have discussed the risk that there might be items that I may have missed, however, considering most of the high priority data points do already exist we understand CBA should be able to commence their development tasks with the list I have provided.  We understand that any items that I have missed will then have a 3 month lead time (extra) to be ingested.

 

We’ve noted this on our risk register, added as many mitigation activities as we can, and James, as Product Owner, is aware that we’ve raised it as a risk to the project.

 

Thanks,

Melissa.;;;",,,,,,,,,

Hi Brynn

 

Please review MBLT for CBS 16.

I have also attached a comparison between the MBLT (data sourced from Oracle GG and cross referenced against CBS) and the CBS data model showing its discrepancies.

There were a lot discrepancies for data types. This is expected as their different DBMS but have listed as a FYI because the ingestion process will go from Oracle GG to Omnia.

 

Please let me know if there’s anything further required.

 

Kind Regards

Hi Shannon

 

Yes I previously checked.

 

Ideally ASAP. They want these tables in Omnia by the end of June but due to the delays, we raised a delivery risk with them because they already missed the cutoff point as it generally takes about 3 months for the entire ingestion process.

 

Kind Regards

Hi Alan. The short answer is no, I’ve not attended to the list you sent through. Good news though I guess!  Did you check the list previously against what is in Dev/Prod OaaS already?

 

For the remaining table, by when would you need that done? I’m off on leave for a week starting tomorrow so going to struggle to progress that for a bit. Let me know the urgency and can work backwards from that.

 

Thanks,
Shannon.

Hi Shannon

 

What do you think the ETA would be to load the attached tables into GGBW dev and prod? I doubt you’ll have the capacity to do it before the change freeze (22/03/2024 – 08/04/2024) given the short notice.

Also, do you think this is something I can shadow and learn from you?

 

Kind Regards

Hi Alan. Indeed won’t get these into Prod before the embargo, but that doesn’t apply to Dev. So I can add this to my next sprint kicking off on the 27{^}th{^}. Though would be the week after Easter before they got loaded and replication set up.

 

Prod would need to be some time after that. Can you advise the urgency? I’m away on leave the week 9{^}th{^} – 16{^}th{^} April.

 

This is something I could step you though, though is unpleasantly complicated with multiple teams involved.

 

Are you able to view the content on this link?

[Additional Tables Checklist (GoldenGate into OaaS at CBA) - Cloud Services Platform - Confluence (rtdomau.local)|https://confluence.rtdomau.local:8443/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1174440464]

That’s just the summary steps. If you want a single table put in, we’ve got to step though all those steps. Dev and Prod. Hence, I prefer to do things in larger batches!

Hi Shannon

 

The project has finalised the tables they want in Omnia but it appears the list I sent has already been loaded into Oracle GG dev and prod😲. Did you happen to load these in or did some miracle happen?

 

There’s just one table that hasn’t been loaded in both environments – {*}BM2T1191_BRCMTPTC{*}. Is this something I can do?

Ops has recovered files from achieved (July to Dec) but files are compressed to deflate format making it challenging to process to DIL. We're ingesting data from what we have in source which is Dec 2023 onwards.

Ops (Pradeep) advised that there will be a lot of manual work involved as each day is split into multiple deflates which needs to be unzip instead in order to process.

*BCB_GNRC_MGMT_TRAL_KI2T11S1_TRANSFORM_DIL*
Pradeep advised that this table will be challenging to catch up as the data file is 140GB and is split into multiple parts.

There is data gaps for this table. (see attached).

Need to check with Alex P if there any downstream consumers for this table.

*BCB_USER_SECU_DETL_AK2T1DK1_TRANSFORM_DIL*
Same issue as BCB_GNRC_MGMT_TRAL_KI2T11S1_TRANSFORM_DIL but significantly smaller in file size.

Initially the plan for the table was to uplift to PALM and perform CR for the new columns to be added after cutover.

Due to the jobs put on hold back in July 2023, the Spark table got impacted, meaning the compare job between Spark and Palm failed.

The new columns are dependant for ADR.

We need a decision to either drop Spark table and ingest as new or do cutover and CR. For cutover, this table is dependant on resolution the incidents where jobs were put on hold.

*BCB_KI2T1CU1_ALNPACLS_TRANSFORM_DIL*
*BCB_GNRC_MGMT_TRAL_TYPE_KI2T11O1_TRANSFORM_DIL*
These are reference tables.

{*}Decision{*}:
Do we ingest restored archived data to DIL (Jul to Dec 2023) or continue as BAU with data gaps?

{*}Impact{*}:
No impact. Source load of full extract was performed on December 2023 which will account for all records.

The v1 tables will have a gap in ETL dates between July and December 2023. As such, specific point in time queries between these dates will not work.

The current date will match source and all inserts will be processed. No need for multi-day catch up.

The same solution should work AK2T1DK1. However, it has already been identified by design kaizen that this table does not have a satisfactory design.

Subject: KI2T11S1 and AK2T1DK1 Omnia load gap

Hi team

Just as a FYI, the ETL job for these tables into Omnia stopped since July 2023 with no alerts to Databots. We only picked this up due to a recent CBS ingestion affecting one of these tables.

We were able to perform ETL catch up from December 2023 onwards, however, catch up between July and December is not possible due to length of time.

Source load of the full extract was performed from 13 December which will account for all records in the source table. 
The v1 tables however will have a gap in ETL dates between July and December. As such, specific point in time queries and functions between these dates will not work, we have noted this in Alation for users to be aware of.  As these tables are transactional in nature, this should have no impact on the data quality as users should only be using the current view for querying this table which will contain all records.

Please let me know if there’s anything further you require.

Kind Regards

Hi Jeeva, thanks for the below.

Alan, I’ll get a change up for those this week. Will aim for extract kick off on Friday.

Hi Alan. Not sure if you’ve received the below email but in light of this I’ll get the scripts etc in on the 27th. We can do the extracts etc at any point thereafter (even after the 28th change “limits”) but just a heads up that I’ll be targeting the day before.

Cheers,
Shannon.

Subject: RE: Prod files - CBS 14

Hi Alan. Confirming (after all the upheaval this week!) that the Release 14 extract jobs were set up and kicked off starting business day 26th Feb.

The historical files included:

BCB_AK2T1L71_COCUSREL_20240226.DAT.zip
BCB_AK2T1BM1_ACDISBDT_20240226.DAT.zip
BCB_AK2T12A1_RVW_DATA_20240226.DAT.zip

… and their deltas from 20240227 onwards.

All the others started 20240226, but can obviously pick those up whenever being full extracts each day.


Hi Jeeva, thank you for the scripts etc. Something I noted is that BCB_WK2T1391_WSISDDIT_ appears to be configured under two JOB_IDs (below), and hence getting double extracts each day. Do you have a preference in which JOB_ID it should belong to? I’ll remove it from the other and do the same in GGBW_DEV2 with your agreement.

 


Thanks,
Shannon.

Subject: CBS 14 DS approval

Hi Brynn 

Please review MBLT for CBS 14. I’ve listed the discrepancies below between CBS and the data model.

Column name mispelled in data model:
Table Name	Column Name in CBS	Column Name in DM
AK2T11Q3_INT_PRMT	VLM_LTRL_X	VLM LTRL X
AK2T1BG1_PRODROVR	PROD_RLOV_TO_C	PRDT_C
AK2T1VL1_PRPGSEL	PROD_C	PRDT_C
AK2T1BG1_PRODROVR	PROD_RLOV_FRM_C	PRDT_C
AK2T1LH1_COPRODRL	PROD_C	PRDT_C
AK2T1X11_ACCTTIER	ACCT_N	CKS_ACT_N
AK2T1331_CKSGLPST	GL_POST_X	GL_POST_TYP_N
AK2T1161_LMTDSBDT	LMT_TYPE_C	LMT_TYP_C

Primary key incorrect in data model:
Table Name	Column Name	Primary Key in CBS	Primary Key in DM
AK2T1VL1_PRPGSEL	PROD_C	Yes	No
AK2T1BG1_PRODROVR	PROD_RLOV_FRM_C	Yes	No
AK2T1LH1_COPRODRL	PROD_C	Yes	No
AK2T1X11_ACCTTIER	ACCT_N	Yes	No
AK2T1331_CKSGLPST	GL_POST_X	Yes	No

Length incorrect in data model:
Table Name	Column Name	Length in CBS	Length in DM
AK2T1331_CKSGLPST	GL_POST_TYP_N	5	30
AK2T1CB1_PARTNER	ESTMT_ELG_S	1	18
AK2T1331_CKSGLPST	RS_S	1	18
AK2T1331_CKSGLPST	WVE_S	1	18

Scale incorrect in data model:
Table Name	Column Name	Scale in CBS	Scale in DM
AK2T1VL1_PRPGSEL	PROD_C	Scale 6 in CBS	Scale 0 in DM
AK2T1BG1_PRODROVR	PROD_RLOV_FRM_C	Scale 6 in CBS	Scale 0 in DM
AK2T1LH1_COPRODRL	PROD_C	Scale 6 in CBS	Scale 0 in DM
AK2T1X11_ACCTTIER	ACCT_N	Scale 6 in CBS	Scale 0 in DM
AK2T1331_CKSGLPST	GL_POST_X	Scale 6 in CBS	Scale 0 in DM

You will also find delete flags for:
AK2T12A1_RVW_DATA
AK2T1BM1_ACDISBDT
AK2T1L71_COCUSREL
These are required in the MBLT to handle delta loads for Ab Initio and won’t be seen in the data model or CBS.

I’ve also attached a list of differences between CBS and Oracle. These are mainly length and datatypes due to how tables are setup by the DBA when they load from CBS to Oracle.

Please let me know if theres anything further you require.

Kind Regards

Could you please advise whether any further tables than those listed are required for CBS 14. PALM CBS014 - Data and Analytics - Confluence (rtdomau.local)

We’d like to close off your requirements by COB Mon 11/12/23 to move the ingestion process forward.

Please advise ASAP whether any further tables need to be added?

Note: If we don’t hear anything by Tues am 12/12/23 will assume you’re all good with the current ingestion list.

Hi Alan. Should be able to get the updates done in GGBW_DEV2 and tables reloaded by early next week, say Tuesday.

 

Will aim to get the same done and reloaded probably the following Tuesday (24{^}th{^}) in Prod.

 

BB2T12S1_ACEVTEDT is going to be a problem to reload in Production due to size (is 150gb) and will need loaded separately over a weekend so as to limit the impact on normal system processing.  Do you need this done in the next three weeks? Will need some analysis and planning with the CBA DBAs.

 

Thanks

Hi Shannon

 

Historical data is not required. Please add the new columns with new data hence forth.

Update Spark code base to include the two columns so that Ops will be able to create Snap view aligned to Spark code.

Two fields are not present in the Spark Snap *Create* Statement , but it is present in snap view. These fields is also present in other spark view (v1, hist ,curr) as well.  The two columns missing in the Spark Create statement seems to be a mistake.

*Subject:* RE: Release 12 draft MBLT and table meta requirements

 

Hi team

 

Please find revised MBLT for release 12.  The business would like to include 3 additional tables that weren’t previous sent:
|*Table name*|*Comment*|
|CD2T16J1_SANCTCAT |Table not in OaaS|
|CD2T16K1_SNCTCNTY|Table not in OaaS|
|AK2T1DK1_URSECDET|Table in OaaS but needs rebuilding as CBS contains new columns|

 

These tables will go into OaaS around mid-October so Jeeva cannot extract the files.

 

Please note that we’re still waiting for data steward approval.

 

Kind Regards

Subject: RE: Prod files - BCB Release 12

Hi all. Release 12 plus extracts for BK2T12P1_NCUBTRMP went in last night, results are below.

The top (20231126) files are history extracts for those tables. All the rest (20231127) are the day 1 files including deltas or full daily extracts.

Thanks again Jeeva for getting this together. Let me know if any issues.

Regards,
Shannon.

Hi Brynn

 

Please find revised MBLT for release 12.  The business would like to include 3 additional tables that weren’t previous sent:
|*Table name*|
|CD2T16J1_SANCTCAT |
|CD2T16K1_SNCTCNTY|
|AK2T1DK1_URSECDET|

 

These tables will go into OaaS around mid-October so Jeeva cannot extract the files.

 

Please let me know if there’s anything further you require.

 

Kind Regards
